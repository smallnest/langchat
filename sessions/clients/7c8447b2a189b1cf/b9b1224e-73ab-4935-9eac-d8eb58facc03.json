What I Could Do:\n- Check developer documentation resources if you provide them\n- Explain LangGraph concepts in general that might apply to Go\n- Help structure a Go implementation pattern based on LangGraph principles\n\nWould you like:\na) For me to explain the general LangGraph architecture in terms that could be implemented in Go?\nb) Help finding specific Go packages that implement similar functionality?\nc) Something else related to LangGraph and Go?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
