A shebang line for Unix-like systems\n2. Proper function encapsulation\n3. The standard `__main__` guard\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Save this to a file for you?\n2. Explain any part in more detail?\n3. Show variations (like adding user input)?\n4. Demonstrate how to run it?\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!  😊",
